<h1 align="center">Project 1 - Book Club Website</h1>

[View the live project here.](https://a-dan-a.github.io/book-club/)

This is a website for a fictional book club that meets monthly and in person. It has been designed to be responsive on all devices, making navigation easy for anyone who wishes to find out more about the book club. The site is for anyone who might wish to join a book club and gives information enough to tell them about the club, the books and the people as well as giving them a chance to contact the club. This should be welcoming and informative to different types of users.

### Further Testing

-   The website was tested on Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a laptop and a smartphone as well as by using chrome developer tools to test different screen sizes.
-   Testing was done to make sure all of the pages linked to each other and to any external links properly.

-   Testing was done with Google's Lighthouse devtool. The index page scored lower in performance and best practices because of issues relating to the embedded Youtube video.

### Known Bugs

-   The footer was oriented to one side of the page. This was fixed by removing 'inline-block' from the CSS.

-   Form attribute types were flagged as wrong by the validator. These had not had the attributes changed from the original Bootstrap code and this was fixed.

-   Fixed CSS not working by adding scripts to each page.
    
        <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js"></script>
        <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@popperjs/core@2.9.3/dist/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
        <script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>

-   Fixed background image on main page. The file path was wrong and google devtools was used to investigate the problem, perform online edits to test out solutions and then apply the solutions to the code.

        From:     
        background: url('/assets/images/bookcase.jpg') no-repeat bottom right fixed;
    
        To:
        background: url('assets/images/bookcase.jpg') no-repeat bottom right fixed;

-   Fixed broken image links in README by amending the filepath.

        From:
        <img src="/assets/readme-images/webaimthankyou.png" width="500">
        
        To:
        <img src="assets/readme-images/webaimthankyou.png" width="500"> 

-   Fixed form validation issue by removing 'onclick' from code.

        From:
        <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary" onclick="window.location.href='thankyou.html'">Submit</button>
        
        To:
        <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>

2. Navigate to this [repository](https://github.com/A-Dan-A/book-club/).
3. Go to settings and select pages.
4. Select 'deploy from a branch' and 'main' as the root.
5. There should now be a link to the published website once it is ready.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository a copy of the original repository is made, so we can make changes without the original being changed.

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository,above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. A copy of the original repository should now be in your account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Click "Clone or download", which are underneath the repository name.
3. Copy the link under "Clone with HTTPS" and this will clone the repositor using HTTPS.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, then paste the URL that you copied in Step 3.
7. Press Enter, and your local clone will be created.
